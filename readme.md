## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MohdYahyaMahmodi/barcode-scanner.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd barcode-scanner
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser or set up a local server.

For PWA functionality, you need to serve the app over HTTPS. You can use GitHub Pages or any other HTTPS-enabled hosting service.

## Usage

1. Allow camera access when prompted by your browser.
2. Select your preferred camera from the dropdown (if multiple are available).
3. Point your camera at a barcode.
4. Once scanned, click on the store buttons to search for the product.

## PWA Features

This application supports Progressive Web App features:

- üì≤ Install on home screen for quick access
- üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Faster load times after initial visit
- üñ•Ô∏è Full-screen mode for an app-like experience

To install the PWA:
1. Open the app in a supported browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge)
2. Click the install button in the address bar or browser menu
3. Follow the prompts to add the app to your home screen

## How It Works

The application consists of three main files:

1. `index.html`: Structures the web page and includes necessary scripts and PWA metadata.
2. `style.css`: Provides styling for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
3. `app.js`: Contains the core functionality of the barcode scanner.

### Key Components:

- **Camera Initialization**: Uses `navigator.mediaDevices` to access the device's camera.
- **Barcode Scanning**: Utilizes Quagga.js to detect and decode barcodes in real-time.
- **Multi-Store Search**: Generates links to search for the scanned barcode on various online stores.
- **Scan History**: Manages a list of recent scans using browser's local storage.
- **PWA Support**: Implements a web app manifest and necessary meta tags for installability.

### Barcode Detection Process:

1. Continuously captures video frames from the camera.
2. Processes each frame to detect potential barcodes.
3. Decodes detected barcodes and validates the result.
4. Updates the UI with the scanned barcode and search options.
